*                                                                           *
*    In order to flash back to an older level of BIOS, the following        *
*    steps should be used to insure the latest flash utility is used.       *
*                                                                           *
*    1.  Make sure the itme "Secure Roll Back Prevention" is set to "No"    *
*        in BIOS setup security page.                                       * 
*        Obtain the older level and latest level BIOS update programs       *
*        from the Lenovo website.                                           *
*    2.  Use the method described in section 3 to unpack the program into   *
*        "C:\SWTOOLS\FLASH\M1UJYnnUSA".                                     *
*    3.  Copy imageM1U.ROM from the older BIOS update program folder,       *
*        paste it and replace the same file in the latest level BIOS        *
*        update program folder.                                             *
*    4.  In the latest level BIOS update program folder, run flash.cmd      *
*        to flash back to an older level BIOS.                              *
*                                                                           *

*                                                                           *
*  1.The BIOS update process consists of two phases. The first phase        *
*    happens in the OS. After the first flashing phase is complete, the     *
*    system will automatically reboot to perform the secondary              *
*    BIOS update phase.                                                     *
*                                                                           *
*  2.Deploy mode is designed for BIOS update deployment when the            *
*    administrator wants to manually control the system reboot after first  *
*    BIOS phase update has finished. With the parameter "/quiet" or "/sccm",*
*    the system won't reboot immediately after applying the first phase of  *
*    the BIOS update.                                                       *
*                                                                           *
*  3.The administrator must REBOOT/SHUTDOWN the system later to             *
*    trigger the secondary phase of the BIOS update.                        *
*                                                                           *
*    Important Notes:                                                       *
*                                                                           *
*    1. After the first phase of the BIOS update is complete, the           *
*       administrator must REBOOT or SHUTDOWN the system to trigger         *
*       the secondary phase.                                                *
*    2. The REBOOT mentioned in Note 1 will trigger the secondary phase     *
*       immediately. It only works if  Setup is set to boot in UEFI mode.   *
*       It does not work if Setup is set to boot the system in Legacy mode  *
*    3. The SHUTDOWN mentioned in Note 1 must be an actual                  *
*       S5 (System Power Off). The default shutdown behavior in             *
*       modern OS (WIN8/WIN8.1/WIN10 etc.) is S4 (Hibernate). To change     *
*       these modern OS shutdown behavior to S5, you need to turn off       *
*       the "Fast Startup" from "Control Panel -> Power options". If your   *
*       deployment software supports S5 shutdown, you can send a sleep S5   *
*       command by software to trigger the secondary BIOS update phase.     *
*       If the system is not shut down using the S5 shutdown, the flash     *
*       process will not continue, and will need to be restarted from       *
*       phase 1.                                                            *
